# Commit Log: Initial Particle System Implementation

**Date:** (Current Date and Time)
**Sprint:** 4 (Core Logic Focus)
**Task:** 4.3 - Basic Python particle emission logic

## 1. What was done?
- Created a new file `src/core/particle_system.py`.
- Implemented the initial `Particle` dataclass. This class holds properties for individual particles such as `id`, `position`, `velocity`, `acceleration`, `color`, `size`, `age`, `lifespan`, `is_alive`, `rotation`, and `angular_velocity`. It also includes a basic `update(dt)` method for simple physics (age progression, movement based on velocity and acceleration, rotation).
- Implemented the initial `ParticleSystem` class. This class is responsible for:
    - Managing a list of `Particle` instances.
    - Initializing with an optional `EffectIR` and `emitter_id` to fetch emitter properties.
    - Emitting new particles based on an `emission_rate` parameter (potentially animated via `EffectIR`). It includes logic for fractional particle emission (`_emission_debt`).
    - Updating the state of all active particles by calling their individual `update` methods.
    - Removing dead particles (those whose `age` has exceeded their `lifespan`).
    - Providing a `get_alive_particles()` method.
- Added placeholder imports for `EmitterProperties` and `EffectIR` from `.ir` to allow the `__main__` block to run even if `ir.py` isn't directly found in the Python path during standalone script execution. These placeholders have minimal functionality for testing.
- Included an `if __name__ == '__main__':` block in `particle_system.py` for basic demonstration and testing of the system. This block sets up a mock `EffectIR` and `EmitterProperties`, initializes the `ParticleSystem`, runs a simulation loop, and prints output.

## 2. Bugs Encountered & Solutions
- No specific bugs were reported or encountered during the creation and initial testing of this `particle_system.py` file. The primary focus was on establishing the foundational structure.
- A potential challenge anticipated was the import of `.ir` when running `particle_system.py` as a script. This was proactively addressed by including `try-except ImportError` blocks and placeholder classes for `EmitterProperties` and `EffectIR` to ensure the `__main__` demo block could function for basic validation.

## 3. Process & Developments
- **Process:**
    1.  Confirmed alignment on Sprint 4, Task 4.3.
    2.  Planned the basic structure for `Particle` and `ParticleSystem`.
    3.  Wrote the code for `src/core/particle_system.py`, including the classes and a `__main__` test block.
    4.  User confirmed the `__main__` block runs successfully, validating the initial implementation.
- **Key Developments:**
    - Established the foundational Python classes for individual particle representation and particle system management.
    - Integrated the concept of fetching emitter parameters (like `emission_rate`, `lifespan`, `initial_velocity`, `particle_color`, `particle_size`, `emitter_position`) from `EmitterProperties` (via `EffectIR`), allowing these to be potentially animated. This connects the particle system to the previously developed `ir.py`.
    - Implemented a basic particle lifecycle: emission, update (age, position, velocity), and death/removal.
    - Ensured the module can be run standalone for basic testing, which is crucial for iterative development.
    - Clarified with the user that while inspired by advanced VFX tools like Talos, our system will be sprite-based to ensure Spine compatibility. Generative features will manipulate sprite properties, not generate visuals from scratch.

## 4. Next Steps (Post-Commit)
- Expand `EmitterProperties` in `ir.py` to include more parameters for particle initialization and behavior (e.g., velocity spread, angular velocity, initial rotation, acceleration).
- Implement "affect over lifetime" features (e.g., color over life, size over life) by allowing these to be defined in `EmitterProperties` and applied in `Particle.update()` or `ParticleSystem.update()`.
- Further refine the integration between `ParticleSystem` and `EffectIR` for more complex scenarios.
- Begin planning for renderer nodes (e.g., Sprite Renderer) that will use these particle data to draw them.
